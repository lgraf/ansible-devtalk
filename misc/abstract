Overview:
-----------------
1. What is ansible
 - Short description
 - Agentless
   - No Bootstraping of servers (managment of mangment)
   - Trusted and already existing security model (SSH)
   - No Agent (push) means no performance overhead of servers (many machines)
   - Different connection modes (open ssh/paramiko/local)
 - Configuration as data not code (yaml)

 - Concepts (Image!)
   - Inventories
     - List/Groups of host can be dynamic (default /etc/ansible/hosts)
     - Groups of groups

   - Playbooks
     - Contains of plays
       - Contains of Tasks
         - Tasks call modules
   Executed in this order expect of handlers (can be triggerd by tasks)


   - Roles
     - Organization tool
     - Resuable component
     - defined by filesystem strcuture
     - role default,variables, dependencies
     - ansible galaxy

   - Variables
     - Playbook
     - Inventory(group vars, host vars)
     - CMD
     - Discoverd variables (facts) (show example,ip tables example)

 - Many modules
   - (ad-hoc example)
   - package,service,file,template
 - All in one configuration managment, orchestration and deployment (multi-tier)


How we use it for salesforce right now:
------------------------
Server migration -> start to use it
1. Configuration for a multi-tier application (reverse-proxy, application machine)
2. Configuration of different environments (dev,staging,(pre)prod)


What is good/bad:
------------------------
 * Developer setup
 * Setup of stages
 * Automation is the base for ci/cd.
 * No ansible client for windows (vagrant box)
 * Jump host setup











Intersting stuff:
------------------------------
 * Rolling updates and orchestration
 * Deployment
 * Ansible tower
